# Mapping Earthquakes

Using JavaScript, Leaflet, and Mapbox tools, this code visualizes earthquake activity from the last 7 days. The data, in .json format, was taken from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program. The techtonic plate data was taken from gitHub, and is based on _An updated digital model of plate boundaries_ by Peter Bird (Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems, 4(3), 1027, [doi:10.1029/2001GC000252](http://scholar.google.se/scholar?cluster=1268723667321132798), 2003).

## Instructions for use
 
When you open the page you will see circle markers representing recent erathquake events from the last 7 days, with different sizes and colors according to magnitude. Use the legend in the bottom right corner to see the key of colors and magnitudes. 

In the upper right hand corner, you wil see a layers icon. Click this to toggle between the three different map types:
